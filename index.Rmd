### Purpose
There purpose of Basic Regression Application is to help Data Scientist do quick Exploratory Analysis and Simple Regression Modeling on selected Data Sets.

This is a basic application, but the idea can be expanded to develop a advanced tool to do sophisticated analysis.

#### Why this application
So if we have R and other similarly Sophisticate Tools to do Data Science  why do we need this application, Some of the reasons for using this application are: 

1. Simple Interface - Select few parameters and You get Basic Exploratory Graph and Calculations
2. No Coding Required - Just Focus on the Data and its Properties.
3. Available online - Can be accessed from any computer including your iPads, Smartphone etc. just anything that can connect to internet.

### How it Works
This application allow Data Scientist(Student or Anyone) to do basic regression on datasets available in R. 

1. The user can select the DataSet 
2. Then they can select two variable on which they want to do Basic Regression.
3. The Application then  Generates Exploratory Graphs like histogram of Variables Selected, Plots a Graph how Varibles are Related.
4. The application then Fits a Linear Model from Origin and Displays Statistical Summary of Linear Fit.
5. The application also displays Data Set data as a Table.

### Sample Exploratory Graph Generated by the Application
This is a Exploratory Graph generate by the Application, Refer to the Slide RMD file for the R code that generates this graph [here at github.](https://skahali.shinyapps.io/devdataprod-assignment/).

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.height=5}
      library(UsingR)
      data(galton)
      
      freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
      par(mfrow=c(2,2))
      # Histogram Outcome
      hist(galton$child, 
           xlab = "child", 
           main = paste("Histogram of Outcome"),
           col="blue",breaks=100)
      
      # Histogram Predictor
      hist(galton$parent, 
           xlab = "parent", 
           main = paste("Histogram of Predictor"),
           col="blue",breaks=100)    
      
      # Plot Outcome and Predictor 
      plot(galton$parent,galton$child,
           xlab = "parent",
           ylab = "child",
           main = paste("Compare Outcome vs Predictor"),
           pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
           cex = .15 * freqData$freq)
      
      # Plot Outcome and Predictor with Best Fit
      plot(galton$parent,galton$child,
           xlab = "parent",
           ylab = "child",
           main = paste("Visualize Best Fit Line"),
           pch = 21, col = "black", bg = "lightblue",
           cex = .05 * freqData$freq 
           )
      lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
      lines(galton$parent,lm1$fitted,col="red",lwd=3)
```
